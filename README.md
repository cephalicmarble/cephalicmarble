- 👋 Hi, I’m @cephalicmarble in many places, after viewing wordsmith.net during a student drinking session circa 1998.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, curly-brace type erasures and much much more (not so much).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning systems security with the Open University, where I brought my first Bachelors up with my second Bachelors so I could get a grant for my studies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that will improve the lot of the everyday coder.
- 📫 You can reach me on hotmail and on gmail and on linkedin and on instagram.
